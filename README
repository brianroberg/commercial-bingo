# Super Bowl Commercial Bingo Generator

This script generates bingo cards that can be used as a side-game for Super Bowl parties. It uses ReportLab to generate a PDF file that has two bingo cards per page.

Besides being a fun game, its aim is to help participants develop greater discernment about how advertising affects them.

## Features

- Generates multiple bingo cards (two per page) in PDF format
- Includes title and instructions on each card
- Uses random selection of persuasive techniques for each card
- Maintains consistent formatting and layout
- Supports text wrapping and hyphenation for readability

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- ReportLab library (`pip install reportlab`)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependency:
```bash
pip install reportlab
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python bingo_generator.py
```

The script will generate a PDF file named `bingo_cards.pdf` in the same directory.

## Configuration

You can modify the following variables at the top of the script:

- `TITLE`: The title that appears on each card
- `INSTRUCTIONS`: The instructions text for players
- `NUM_PAGES`: Number of pages to generate (2 cards per page)
- `CENTER_SQUARE`: The text that appears in the center square of each card
- `TECHNIQUES`: List of persuasive techniques used to populate the cards

## Output

- Creates a landscape-oriented PDF
- Each page contains two bingo cards
- Cards include a title, instructions, and 5x5 grid
- Grid squares contain randomly selected persuasive techniques
- Center square always contains "Humor"

## How to Play

Tell players to mark squares by writing down the brand name when they see commercials using the listed persuasive techniques. A win is achieved by marking 5 squares in a row (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal).
